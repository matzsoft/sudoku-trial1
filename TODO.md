# Things Remaining To Do.

For now, in no particular order, this is a list of things needed.

1. Figure out @Publisher, @State, and @Environment work and how to use them to control data sharing and View updates.
1. I would like Cell and Drawer to know what SudokuPuzzle they belong to without sacrificing immutability.
1. Allow editing of the puzzle cells.
1. Save an edited file to disk.
1. Allow graphics files as input, coverting them to puzzles.
1. Speech verification of puzzles.
1. A "show the solution" option.
1. An interactive "solve the puzzle" mode.
